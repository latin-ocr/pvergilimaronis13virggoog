THE ECLOGUES. 13

the people too, looked forward to the coming age 01 peace and
progress, Vergil should have coupled the name 01 theson 01
Qvi-protector* Polio and so combined the national
hopes with the personal feelings and joyiul anticipations 01 the
consul to whom a child was bom' m the year 01 his high office.
The main difficulty in taking these glowing lines as applied to
the son 01 a minister, and not 01 Augustus, is the extraordinary
destiny which the poet sketches 101 the iniant But 11 we regard
them as the halfflayiul though wholly affectimtate prophecies 01
the grateful youth, who owed to Polio his escape from poverty
and his introduction to the high society in which he hencelorth
moved, the difficulty is overcome. The annals 01 literature will
supply many examples 01 poems addressed to patrons in which
the expression is none the less sincere at bottom because it
admits certain licensed and traditional exaggerations.

that we have risen out of the region 01 the prettinesses of the
earlier Eclog oues into something 01 the largeness 01 manner and
sustained dignity 01 cupression—always combined with a great
Qeauty and variety 01 melodyy-which distinguishes Vergil’s
ter work.
ln the eighth Eclogue Vergil returns to his Theocritean
studies again. But here als0, though in form he is very closely
imitating two 01 the ldylls of Theocritus, and trying the new
experiment, aster his model, 01 songs accompanied with a
refrain, yet there is a perfectly free handling 01 his original, and
a great deal 01 variation in detail. Nothing can show the
rapidly developing genius 01 the poet so strikingly as a
comparison of the five most beautiful lines in the Eclogue with
the passage by which they are suggested in the Greek. The
lines are as follows:

saepibus in nostris parvam te roscida mala-
dux ego vester eram—vidi cum matre legentem.

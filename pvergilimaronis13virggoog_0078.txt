amongst other assignments being Vergil’s farm. The poet’s
first acquaintance with Augustus was due to this event; for he
applied to him at Rome for the restitution of his property, and
was successful. He became the friend of the rich art-patron
Maecenas, the poet Horace, and the brilliant circle of literary
men who were collected at the court of Augustus. The works
of Vergil·are not voluminous. ,The Eclogues are ldylls in imi·
tation of the Greek poet Theocritus, and were written sometime
before he was 33. The Georgics, an agricultural poem in four
books, of which the form was more or less suggested by
Hesiod, he wrote in the next few years, finishing thern some-
time about his 4oth year. The Aeneid, his great work, he
appears to have begun about· ae 27, when he was 43 years of
age, at the wish of Augustus. A few years later, finding his
health falling, he tried travelling; and in the spring of 19 he
was at Athens. The summer he spent with Augustus abroad,
but died a few days after reaching Brundusium on his return.
The day of his death was Sept. 22, and he was not quite 51.
He was buried at Naples, where his tombis still shewn, though
the authenticity of it is at least doubtful

His character seems to have been most simple, pure, and
loveable ; and his poetic farne was well established even before
his death.

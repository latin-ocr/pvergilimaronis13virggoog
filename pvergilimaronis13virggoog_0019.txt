Julius Caesar is lamented under the name of Daphnis, the
unreality of youthlul poetry may be said to be hereat its
height. Nohody in the world could be less like a beautiful
young shepherd, lately dead, and lamented during their summer
siesta byhis youthful comrades, than Julius Caesar: and nothing
could be less like the genuine horrors of the year 42-the year
of Philippi—than the mock troubles ol the Sicilian shepherd·
songs. ·

ln the seventh Eclogue, which, as we have seen above, must

huc ip'si potum venient per prata iuvenci;
hic virides tenera praetexit arundine ripas
Mincius ......

All through these early Eclogues we have, in spite of
incongruities and crudities os taste, an ease and melody of
versification, andan occasional touch os real poetic description,
enough to show that Vergil was not a mere imitator.

The second group consists of those two that reler to the poet’s
sarrn and the difficulties (sufficiently explained above) connected
with the confiscation and restitution of the land .

In this group, though the form of the Greek pastoral is still
oi course the main thing, and even in the details there is much
direct imitation, we note this change, that the poet is now using
the eclogue chiefly for allegorical purposes; what he wishes to
¹convey is his doubts, his lears, and his gratitude, concerning the
fate of his fann; and moreover he feels himself at liberty to drop
the allegorical tone, and digress still further from the eclogue
proper, whenever it happens to be convenient, so as to mention

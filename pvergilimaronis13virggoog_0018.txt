THE ECLOGUES. ¹ 9 '

hints from one ldyll after another; and there are all manner of
adaptations and modifications and free handlings of the original
Both the differences and the close resemblances are accounted
for when we remember that what he wanted was to be the Latin
Theocritus ε that while he did not wish merely to translate, it is
his express object to give us the atmosphere of the Greek poet
whom he imitates. Let us take the first group in order. In the
second Eclogue there is absolutely nothing but Greek imitation ;
no allusion, no allegory, no reference to current events. How-
ever the ruere transference of the Greek original into easy and
mellifluous Latin verse was at the time when the young poet
wrote no small achievement. And even here we ohserve the
delicate ear, the suggestive fancy, and, above all, the genuine
love of the country, which is so marked a feature of the Georgics‚
and which pierces through the artifieial atmosphere of these
early poems‚ in such lines as

o tantum libeat mecum tihi sordida rura
atque humiles habitare casas, et figere cervos...

or again the beautiful lines 45-50, which describe the nymphs
plueking and wearing the flowers ; or most of all

......... Pallas quas condidit arces
ipsa colat; nobis placeant ante omnia silvae.

The third Eclogue is in the main part of it quite as complete
a Theocritean imitation as the second; but towards the end the
poet weaves into the singing match of the supposed Greek
shepherds a reference to Polio, and his literary quarrels with
Bavius and Maeviuse This incongruous allusion comes in
with the most crude and grotesque effect3 but it may be
noticed as the first somewhat unsuccessful attempt at what
afterwards became such a favourite ground for young poets-
namely the conversion of the pastoral poem into an artificial
vehicleforreference to current events and contemporary persons.
Again in the fifth Eclogue we have the same characters to

notice in the poetry; there are touches shewing the real lover
of nature, but the poems are for the most part experiments in
versifying Greek models. And if we are right in supposing that

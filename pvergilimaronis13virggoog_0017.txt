8 INTRODUCTION.

line. The whole must have been published some time before
the first book of Horace’s Satires, where Vergil is spoken of as
the recognised representative of rustic poetry, Sat. i. 10, 45.
This book of Satires is dated 35 lte, and we may therefore
accept the ordinary date given for the appearance of the
Eclogues as about 37.
The following table will then give the dates of the Eclogues

3. T lte execution os tlte Poem.

We are now in a position to consider the execution of the
Eclogues regarded as a work of art ; for the arrangement of the
pieces in some sort of chronological order is a great help
towards understanding the growth of the poet’s mind and the
development of his art.

The first four, that is, the second, third, fifth, and sevcnth,

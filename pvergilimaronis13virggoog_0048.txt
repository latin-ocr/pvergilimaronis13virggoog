THE Gaoacrcs. 39

yet the need which gave rise to labour was in the end beneficial:
‘The father himself willed it' (121); he would not have ‘sloth
and torpor' (124); the change produced various inventione
(ι 35) and all the arts of lise (145). Though the sarmer’s toil is
¹never-ending (redit labor actus in orbem), still his life is
, supremely happy, o fortunati m'rnium...agn'colaa The dignity
⁵ oi this toil is suggested by the constant use of words meaning
conquest; imperat arvis, subactis scrobibus, cogere, domare, dcc.
In the same spirit we have a con amore description oi the busy
variety oi life on wet days (i. 260); of the wife singing at her
loom (i. 290); of the poet’s visit to the garden of the old man
ol Corycus (iv. 132) whose happiness ‘matched the wealth of
kings'; in the same spirit again is the playful energy ol the
simile which depicta the sarmer like the soldier harling his seed,
grappling the land, laying low the heaps (i. 104), and most
notable of all, the passage at the end oi book ii. where he
contrasts the delight oi the ceaseless labour oi the husbandmen
with the vain or disastrous energias oi the courtier, the soldier,
the merchant, the orator, the statesman or the conqueror (ii.
501 squ).

Another point (quite as significant, though less noticeable at
first sight) which shews tlte poet's delight in his subject is the
constant emergence in the Georgics ol what we may call a
spirit oi playsulness. Vergil’s delicate and ‘finely touched
spirit’ inclined rather to pathos and to seriousness, and in the
whole Aeneid we have hardly the least sparkle os humour
(though in the Iliad there is no lack oi it and in the Odyssea
it abounds): but in this poem his love of the country lise, and
its objecta and details, not unfrequently finds expression in a
certain gaiety of thought or phrase which conveys to the reader
a sense of his pleasure in the soenes he describes. Sometimes
it is the playsulness os exaggeration: the ‘rustling iorest’ ol
the lupine, the comparison (mentioned above) oi the larmer's
energy to a battle, the ‘homes and garner' of the mouse, the
weevil ‘sacking’ the cornbin, the ant's ‘needy old age': some-
times an amusing picture ortum oi phrase, as the ‘tiresome'
goose (improbus), the sceleratum frigus, the raven who ‘stalks

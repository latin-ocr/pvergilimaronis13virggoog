Italy the Greek Elegiae mette: Propertius makes Callimachus
his model: and Vergil announces himself in the Georgics as

‘singing the song of Ascra (Hesiod’s birthplace) through the ¹

Roman towns! But it is not merely that the general form of
the poem is suggested by Greek; nor that the subject and mette
are bortowed from Hesiod; far more important is the tosto
os lz'teraoy assonation with which the workmanship abounds.
Both the poet and those for whom he wrote were possessed with
the greatness and beauty of Greek literature; and the poem at
every turn is intended to remind thern of it. Sometimes this is
done with a mere epithet: the ‘Chaonian' acorn, the ‘ Lethean'
poppy‚ the ‘Acheloian' cups of water, the ‘Paphian' myrtle,
‘Amyclaean ’ dogs, ‘Cretan' quiver, the ‘Idaean' pitch‚ ‘Cecro-
pian' bees. More often a passing allusion or phrase touches
some partos the rich and pictoresque Greek mythology: ‘The
wagons of the Eleusinion mother' (reminding us of the tales of

Demeter, the mysteries of Eleusis the Athenian processions to ’

the¹ temple of Artemis dic) ; The ‘prizes of wit which the sons
of Theseus ordained' (reminding us of the worship of Dionysus
and all the glories of the Athenian stage); ‘Till the Atlantides
be hidden' (the story of the Pleiads); ‘The Olympian palm'
(reminding us of the great guthering of Greece at Elis for the
five-year festival): the power of love on man to make him ‘swim
the dark straits at midnight’ (referring to the beautiful tale of
Hero and Leander); and similar reference in other places to
Ariadne, Alcyone, Scylla, Hylas, Chiron, Parnasus, &c Or
again common things are beautified with a more direct literary
reference :if the poet mentions waterbirdr, they ‘sport round
Caystrian pools, in the Asian meads': an orchard reminds him
of the ‘groves of Alcinous’3 the lightning strikes ‘Athos or
Rhodope or the Ceraunian rocks'; the wtecked sailor vows ‘to
Glaucus and Panopea and Melicerta son of Ino'; the gadfly
suggests the tale of Juno's jealousy; the horse reminds him of
Epidaurus, Elis, the Homeric tale of the horses of Achilles and
Pollux, Erechtheus the inventor of cars, and the Lapithae of the
saddle; white wool is ‘such a gift as that wherewith Pan
beguiled Luna’; and last but not least a mysterious disease

that no other soil breeds snakes so well! This playfulness is

found also in the third book, as when he speaks of there being r
‘no limit' to a good conss length, of the horse’s ‘ grief ’ at losing ¹

and ‘pride' at winning a race, of ‘exhorting' the young calves
while ‘their mind is pliant' (dum faciles anima), or of the
defeated buli who recovers his spirit 3ηά ‘breaks camp’ (sagum
movet) against the foe. But far most remarkably of all is this
playfulness shewn in the fourth book, when treating of the bees.

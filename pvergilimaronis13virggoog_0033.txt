24 INTRODUCTION.

or shared all the feelings which resulted lrom them, still the
Georgics shew many deep traces.

ln the famous passage (ii. 475) ‘Me vero primum dulces
ante omnia Musae &o’ the poet plainly declares that the highest
honour and delight is to expound in poetry all the secret lore
of nature: and that the tasi< he had set himself, to describe the
country life, was though a happy one, still second to the other.
Again besides his general reverence lor his masters study and
doctrine, we have special traces of the intluence: in his feeling
of the presence ol Nature as agreat and universal productive
power (ii. 9, 20, 47): in the sense of a constant need lor struggle
on the partos man (i. 155, 200), and the number of counter·
influences that thwart his labours (i. 118); in the recognition

1 that there was once a golden age when things were easier aud
¹ l earth was richer-an age which is past (i. 127); even in some
special doctrines like the ‘hidden pores of earth’ (i. 9ο), or the
materialist explanation ol the birds' weather-signs (i. 415); and
generally in his poetic ascription to inanimata things ot feelings

and tendencies drawn from man’s nature.

There can be no doubt that in the magnificent passage
above referred to the lines ‘Felix qui potuit rerum cognoscere
causas &c.’ were intended to pay a direct tribute to Lucretius,
by suggesting that the latter’s work was the highest aim and
achievement ol the poet's art: a tribute which was all the
greater as Vergil did not name him, secing that no other
identification was possible.

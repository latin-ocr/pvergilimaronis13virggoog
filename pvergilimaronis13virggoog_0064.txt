THE ravato. 55

must reveal themselves to those who have ears to hear anda
heart to ieel.

Of the metre it must suffice to say broadly that Vergil truly
created it, and that it died with him. Oi his predecessors Ennius
writes it with rugged force, Lucretius with nobleness, and depth,
and grandeur, Catullus with grace and passion. Of his con·
temporaries and successors, Ovid can use it with cleverness,
point, and swiitness, Lucan can force it into epigram, dignified,
cogent, and compact‚ Juvenal at his best can make it a vehicle
sor fine rhetorical satire, majestic and even pathetic. Vergil alone
unfolded and commanded its full resources. ln one word his
superiority consists, on the more technical side, in a far greater
variety os rhythm, by his use os elision, pause, caesura, and
arrangement of seet; and on the higher side in an infinitely
more subtle sense both of sound and oi the power of language.

Lastly there is the more peculiar quality, closely connected
with those referred to, hut more profound, which only the
greatest poets possess ι the art whereby the words that seem the
simplest, and are naturally spoken of the incidente and actors in
the drama, have somehow awider significance and touch deeper
springs in our nature ; words which haunt the memory with a
charm aud a force which we cannot ever fully explain. Mr
Myers gives a striking list os such effects, on minds the most
different, of ull ages, since the poet's day1. Dr N ewman speaks
of Vergil's ‘single words and phrases, his pathetic halt lines
‘giving utterance as the voice of nature herself to that pain and

‘weariness yet hope of better things, which is the experience os
‘her children in every time².'

A lew examples out of a multitude is all our space permits. 2

No onp can help feeling the majestic and imperial quality of
lines li e

given to the Carthage episode. The older epics brought Aeneas
to Carthage3 andVarro² had told how Anna slewherself for love
of the hero. Vergil, in making Dido the victim, gives an incom-
parably more impressive significance to the tragedy as a sort of
allegory of the Punic war. The love and death of Anna would
be a tribute to the greatness of Aeneas,but otherwise irrelevant:
the despair and suicide of Dido would typify the national fate
of Carthago„

And if for these reasons Aeneas would be more interesting
to the Rome of Vergil¹s time than to us, the same is true of the
numberless allusions to ltalian places, stories, or ceremonies,
which make the Aeneid a storehouse of sacred and patriotic
memories. On the voyage, the streame and towns of the
Tarentino gulf, of Sicily, of the Campanian coast, are named as
the ijan exiles pass. Hardly a place in Latium is unnoticed,
when they are lauded: and the embassies, the friendly visits,
the catalogues uf confederata Latins (vii. 641), and of allied
Tuscans (a 143), are used for the same purpose. Etruria,
Umbria, Campania, Picenum, Samnium, the Aequi, Volsci,
Hernici, Marsi, Aurunci-all the famous tribe-names and
the oldest settlements are introduced with skill and picturesque
variety. We see the islands, Prochyta, Aenaria, llva: the
mountains‚ Apennine, Soracte, Silas, Taburnus, Vesulus ; the
lakes, Avernus, Fucinus, Nemi, Garda, Velinus3 the rivers
and streame, Padus, Adige, Nar, Allia, Mincio, Anio, Numicius,
Simaethus, Minio, Tiber. In book viii. Aeneas is escorted
'round the sacred places of Rome itself-the Asylum, Lupercal,

Argiletum, Capitol, Palatine. The same patriotic spirit appears .

in the fondness Vergil shews for tracing back to fanciful or
mythical origin the ancient names, as Laurentes, Circeii,
Aventinus, Alba, Palatina, Latium, Mantua, or the gentile
names lulius, Sergius, Atius, Cluentius Very frequent too are
the mentions of local worships or ceremonies;-the Actian
games, the ‘Troia' the opening and closing of lanus, the grove

feeling of unity with a great past, as thus to enrich his National
epic with every ancient association that admits ol poetic
treatment

3. The poem.

Vergil is the first of Latin poets, and one os the first poets
of the world: and the Aeneid is his greatestwork. Propertius
announced the forthcoming poem in the weh-'known line
‘Nescio quid maius nascitur Iliado’: and from the day ol its
publication it was a classic, and no Roman refers to it except to
praise. No poet has been more deeply loved and revered by the
best in all ages: and to two ol the greatest he was one main
source ol inspiration. Milton's Paradise Lost is filled with
memories of Vergil: and Dante calls him his guide and his
master.

Itis obvious that the sort of merit that is implied by facts
like these cannot be explained to the learner in a few pages oi -
preface to a school-book. To appreciate Vergil thoroughly
requires a fine natural sensibility to poetry, a real and intimate
knowledge of Latin, and perhaps some experiente of life:
and even then it cannot be taught, it must come from within.
Mnch however can be done even by beginners, if thepoet
himself be read with care, and with desire to appreciate. Some
help too can be gained by reading the best poetic translations¹,
and the best criticisms² on the poet’s worln The most that
can be attempted here, is to give a lew general hints towards
seizing some os the more obvious points.

Probably all readers os Vergil, if asked to justily their
admiration, would point first to tbe three great books‚-—the
tragedy of national defeat and ruin in the capture of Troy (Aen.
it); the tragedy ol love, despair, and suicide, in the story os
Dido (Aen. iv.); and the solemn and pathetic visit of Aeneas to

¹ Such as Conington, William Mortis, and Charles Bowen.
² For example Conington's Prefaces; Prof. Sellar's more elaborate
treatise, fullos insight and suggesti0n; Prol. Nettleship's ‘Suggestions

introductory to a stndy os the Aeneid’; and the remarkable essay os
Mr F. W. H. Myers.

THE nervam. 49

the Shades in book vi, which ends with the glorious vision of the
Roman heroes to be, from the ‘ greybearded kings’ of old, to the
youth ‘with night around his head,' the young Marcellus.

ln the first of these, the Tragedy of Troy, we find perhaps
the best specimen of the truly apic quality of Vergil: the
stately and pathetic narrative given in poetry at once powerful
picturesque and melodious. The subject also affords full scope
for other special characteristics of the poet; his reverence for
the gods, his feeling of the power of fate, and his deep sense of
the sadness of human life. All these are shewn in relating the
struggle of the doomed city, with the very gods against it: the
‘dramatic irony' of the Greek fraud beguiling the Trojans to
assist in their own destruction ; the disregarded prophecies and
tragic lates of Laocoon and Cassandra; the fall of the royal
greatness, and the cruel death of Priam and his house.

The Fourth book has perhaps fora modern reader an even
greater interest; for here the victim of Destiny is not a
kingdom, but a woman And the insight, and power, with which
Dido's passion and suffering are painted, shew some of the
higher qualities of the tragic dramatist We see every mood of
the unhappy queen. The yearning and restlessness of the new
love is described in a passage of extraordinary beauty (65-85):
then follow, in lines of ardent and compressed feeling, her
indignant appeal when Aeneas schemes to steal away (305—330),
her scornful exposure of his excuses (365 sqq.), her return to
humble entreaty when the first tumultis over (416-436) and
her final¹ rage and execration (590 sqq.). At the end she rises
to the superb invocation of the unborn Hannibal ‘Exoriare
aliquit nostris ex ossibus ultor’....The earlier poets‚ as we have
seen, had told of Dido’s reception of Aeneas; and all Roman
readers would feel in the meeting os -the two monarchs a
suggestion of the national conflict of Rome and Carthage. The
suggestion is sar more strikingly given by Vergil, as in the love·
tragedy Dido crosses the destiny of Aeneas, and is wrecked.
But it is a notable example of the genius of the poet that
the one direct reference he makes to Hannibal is reserved for
this powerful and dramatic climax in the personat tragedy.

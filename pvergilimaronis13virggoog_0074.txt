tion: but these it is hardly necessary to specify. They can be
found in the Index if desired.

6. Note on tlee Similes.

Vergil has followed Homer in beautifying his poem with a
great many comparisons, many of them indeed directly borrowed
from the lliad or other Greek sources. Once we have an original
simile of a strikingly Roman quality, where Neptune stilling the
storm is compared to a great and good man whose simple
presence quiets a tumult (i. 148). Once too we have a
remarkable literary comparison, where Dido, distracted with
love and dreaming strange dreams, is likened (iv. 468) to
Pentheus who sees visions of Furies, or Orestes flying on· tle

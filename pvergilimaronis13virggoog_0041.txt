INTRODUCTION.

7. Subject and purpose of tlte poem.

Vergil himself describes his subject in the opening lines as
being the tilling of the land, the growing of vines, the breeding
of cattle, and bee-keeping. These four headings closely corre·
spond to the matter of the four books. The Georgics then
(as the name imports) are a Manual for F armers in verse : and
this ostensible purpose was so far attained that the poem was
referred to afterwards (egby Columella the son of a Spanish
farmer, about ab. 1-70, who wrote a comprehensive treatise
on agriculture) as a standard work on the subject; and it is
plain that Vergil was really interested in the practical details of
agriculture, and spoke with knowledge not only derived from
books but also from personal experiente of country life.

But it does not need saying that his purpose went much
further than this. Maecenas (see note on iii. 41) himself is said
to have suggested to the poet the subject, and Maecenas’ interest
in it would naturally be twofold. As a patron of literature he
desired the productiori of a great work of art: and as minister
of Augustus he was anxious to carry out the emperors sincere
and wide-reaching desire of restoring a national spirit, the old
feeling of Italian unity and patriotism.

That the young poet should become the Hesiod of Rome as
he had already become (in the Eclogrtes) the Theocritus: that
he should again delight his readers with his melodious and
imaginative verse, with his richly stored knowledge of the

beauties of Greek literature skilfully worked in, imitated, sug·
gested, in his finished and pregnant style: that he should bring
to bear his deep love for the country, h'ts practical knowledge,
his poetic observation of nature, upon such a work 2-

And again, that he should do something-if not to convert
men from politics and plots, from luxury and vice-at any rate
to turn their thoughts to purer sources of pleasure; to remind
them of the ancient love of Romans for the land, of the old

farmer-heroes who went from the plough to command an army ; ¹

to sing the praise of Italy in memorable verse, to give a new

THE saoneres, 35

among bees gives occasion for the bodily transference into
Vergil's poetry oi the charming sea-sairy-tale of Proteus from
the Och‘ssey.
¹ Again‚ quite apart srorn the rich literary associationS, Vergil y ¹
has notabiy the power of picturesque suggestiveness; often all i
the more effective that the suggestion is given in a word. To
take examples from the earlier books :-He is speaking of spices,
and we see molles Sabaei, ‘unwarlike Arabs’3 of iron, and we
see nudi chalybes, ‘the stripped forgers': the pine tree is
‘doorned to witness the persss oi the sea'; the rich harvest is
‘drawn home by tired heifers’: the evening and morning sky
suggest a crop of pictures, ‘the timeless night,' the ‘Bears sear·
ing to be dipped in Ocean,' the ‘Dawn's panting steeds‚' ‘the
’ turning poles,’ &a So in books iii. and iv.: when he has to say
‘summer' he says ‘when the floor groans with heavy blows upon
the grain, and empty chafi is tossed to the rising Zephyr': the
heat oi noon is ‘when sorrowing crickets crack the bushes with
their song': the evening is the time when ‘the dewy moon
freshens the ghides, the shores echo to the kingfisher‚ the brakes
to the warbler? Indeed the whole poem is alive with such
pictores.

Another common note of Vergil's poetic art is connected with
his deep love of nature, namely the touches of personification
which abound in the poem. Of course the tendency is by no
means peculiar to Vergil, but is found in all poetry: in some
poete however it is often frigid, or artificial, or overloaded‚
whereas the particular meritos Vergil is that his touch is so

’ light and graceful in these personifications Thus in the earlier
books the irozen land is ‘hard with Boreas’ breath’: the seeds
are ‘due to the surrows' ε the South wind‘broods,’ the moon’s
‘virgin face flushes,’ the Sun ‘none can call ialse': the apples
‘feel their strength,' the poor vine is ‘ashamed os her clusters‚’
the graft shoots ‘know not their mother,' the buds ‘are taught,’
the tree ‘wonders ather new leaves‚' the vines in the winter
‘put by the pruning hook,’ the ‘stealthy fire escapes to the
upper leaves and reigns a conqueror‚' the ‘beasts are sent into
the forests and slars into the sky! So in books iii. andin,

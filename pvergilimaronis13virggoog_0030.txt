when writing was comparatively a rare art, as the familiar epic
metre.

But the didactic form once established, it lent itself naturally
in later ages to imitation. Just as there were literary epics1,
imitating the form of Homer, but telling the story for a purpose
(the Aeneid, the Inserno, the Paradt're Lost), so the primitive
didactic poetry of Hesiod or the philosophers gave rise to
the literary didactic poem, which has appeared in all ages
os literary revival. Thus for example the artificial literature
which the Alexandrian scholars produced contained many
didactic poems, such as the astronomical works Phaenomena
and Dzhsemia ot' Aratus (which were mere metrical renderings
of scientific knowledge derived from others), or the works on
poisons‚ venomous beasts, and birds by Nicander. These two
writers lived towards the beginning ol the third, and middle of
the second centuries Β. C. respectively; and to them we might
add the scientific poet Eratosthenes, about the middle of
the third century, from whom Vergil borrowed some os his
astronomical ideas. Similarly in our own so-called Augustan
age, the literary revival os Queen Anne’s reign, there sprang up
a crop os didactic poems; of which the best and most famous
was Pope’s Essay on Man. The aim os all these was rather
to achieve finish of form and brilliance os execution than to
communicate or expuund anything serious.

In the golden age of Rome there were three didactic poems Ι

written, all of them extremely famous, namely Lueretins' De
rerum natura, Vergil’s Georgz’cs, and Horace’s Art os Poetry.
The last was written after Vergil’s death, and need not concern
us here: it is moreover in a class apart. The criticism which
forms its subject-matter is most seriously and careiully thought
out: the form belongs more to what we call versele socirtl,
full of point, vigour, vivacity, and variety, but not addressed
like serious poetry to the feelings or the imagination. On
the other hand Lucretius’ great poem amid its arid stretches
os philosophie argument has oases of the most sublime

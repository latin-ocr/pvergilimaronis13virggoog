THE cuorcrcs. 37

the real effect of the poem depends more on points which
escape analysis: on the fitness of his diction, the vividness
of the pictores, the melody‚ the imaginativeness, the variety,
the delicacy, the impressiveness, the grace, of his phrases and
lines. Towards the appreciation of these thingS, some aid
may be found in the notes and index to these books: but in
th'e main it must be left to each readers ear and taste and
sensibility.

A few words should however be said, secondly, about the
spirit of the Georgics, which has even more to do with their

Mantuan country and his ideal patriotism for the ‘Saturnia
tellus’ which inspire the glowing panegyric on Italy in the
beginning of the same book (ii. 136—176). But it appears no
less in numerous little touches all through the poem. It is

30 Ι INTRODUCTION.

written in a curiously curt and unreadable style. ln the later
Georgics Cato’s authority is chiefly traceable in the remarks on
sheep and goats (iii. 387 sqq.) and the treatment of the scabies
(moses-l·

(5) Μ. Terentius Varro of Reate in B.c. 37 published
at the age of 80 an interesting work in three books with the
same title as Cato’s‚ de Re Rustica. This is used for all the
Georgics, but for the third and fourth books is far the most im·
portant source of Vergil's knowledge, as will appear from the brief
analysis given below: and as it was published just before Vergil
began to write his Georgius, it may very likely have had some
influente, with Maecenas or the poet or both, in determining
the choice of subject. Varro was looked up to as a great
student and manos letters, and is said to have written several

ln the two first Georgics Vergil borrows less from Varro,
though the following points are there treated: (Book i) Produce of
different soils-the work to be done in the different seasons-the
signs of the seasons :—(Book ii) the systems of rearing trees-the
proper places and times for planting and grafting-best land for
vines.
ln the third Georgic, the precepts on the following points
are all found in, and many obviously borrowed from, Varro's
Ι second book :—The choice of cows and horses for breeding-
the feeding of brood animals-their treatment—the food and
training of the young, both cattle and horses-the housing and
feeding of sheep and goats-the use of goatskin-the raising
of wool-dairy-farming—and (very briefly) the rearing of
dogs
ln the fourth Georgic‚ the following points for the bee-farmer
are from Varro z—the origin of bees-their domestic economy-
their respect for their queen (‘king')-the treatment of drones-
their noises—the cultivation of flowers for bees—the best site
for hives-the attractions for bees—the material of hives-
fumigation-the need for killing one queen when there are two
—the various kinds of queens and workers—the signs of disease
—swarming and how to direct it—the three products, wax, bee-

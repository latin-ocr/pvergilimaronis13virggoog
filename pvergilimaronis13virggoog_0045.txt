rivers are ‘rapacious,’ the myrtles ‘love the sbore‚’ winter ‘teins
in the streams with frost,' the narcissus ‘weeps,' the river Po
has ‘bull's head with gilded homs,' aud the mountains are
‘widowed of their snow.'

Further, in the third and fourth books, where the subjecte
(breeding and bec-keeping) might seem alittle too dry or narrow
for sustained poetic interest, he begins more largely to use
other attractione, the episodes and the similes. Thus we have in
the third book, the episodes of the horse racc (with a Homeric
memory); the battle between the bulls, written with asingularly
delicate and even pathetic sympathy; and the fine passage on
the power of love over all creation. The great episode at the end
of book iii, the account of the unknown plague (imitated from
Lucretius), is afine example of Vergil’s power in describing dark
and even horrible things, which is perhaps hardly to modern
taste, though the unpleasantness is more than redeemed by the
force. But nothing in all the Georgics, and few things in any
poetry, can be put above the beautiful episode at the end of

book iv. containing the story of Orpheus and Eurydice. Alien
as this is from the subject of the Georgics¹ and strained and

even crude as is the attempt to make it relevant, for music and
pathos and pure poetic beauty it remains unsurpassed.

Again in the similes, which are iu themselves mostly simple
and obvious, the poet has opportunity of raising direct memories

of Homer, which he always delighted todo: and the passages ,

are (with one striking exception iii. 97) beautiful or effective
pictures which must help to relieve and adorn the less interest·
ing parts of the agricultural doctrine.

These are some of the most prominent points of Vergil's
art, and most easily capable of being illustrated. But of course

¹ There isan old story of dubious authority, though accepted by most
commentatore, that the Georgics originally ended with e panegyric on
C. Cornelius Gallus, a great friend of the poet's‚ who had helped
Augustus in subjugating Egypt: but that when Gallus fell under the
Emperor's displeasure for too great independence and arrogance in his

administ ration ο f,Egypt Vergil changed the end of the fourth Georgic,
end introduced the episode of Aristaeus = ,

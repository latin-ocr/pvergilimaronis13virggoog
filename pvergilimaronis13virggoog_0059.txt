Hannibal is ‘to hunt with fire and sword the Trajan settlers ’ ; he
is to set ‘land against land, sea against sea‚’ and begin a war
which will last for generations; but all this he is to do, not
as the enemy of Rome, but as the ‘unknown avenger’ of the
injured queen.

But greatest of all the· Aeneid-to some minds the greatest
achievement of poetry-is the Sixth book. Vergil’s highest
powers are always in the regions of solemnity‚ and mystery, and
melancholy and deep feeling ; and in the visit of Aeneas to the
Shades he has, it is hardly too much to say, for the first and
last time full scope for shewing his true strength on a large scale.
We have the personal pathos ot the meeting with Palinurus
(341) and Deiphobus (500), and above all with Dido (454): the
touch of romance in the fancy of the golden bough ; the solemn
warning (126) from the Sibyl of the difficulties of the way, which
has not lost its impressiveness even by twenty centuries of
quotation ; the magical lines os mystery as they approach the
Shades (264), with the dread forms of fancy and of myth at the
threshold; the tortures of the impious-—all themora terrible
because it is (so to say) the moral side, the warning and not the
horrors, on which the poet dwells (550); the meeting with his
father-where love is haffled with a vain embrace (700); the
strange and exalted passage (724) where Anchises tells of the
purification of the wicked ancl teaches his son of the ‘World-
spirit' which informs all living things; and at the close the
grand vision of the Romans that are to be (756), the imperish·
able record of the national life. where the poet ‘sums up in
lines like bars of gold the hero-roll of the Eternal city1.’ Last
of all comes the supremely beautiful lament for young Marcellus,
moving the modern reader hardly less than it moved the
bereaved Augustus and Octavia, when Vergil with the ‘strange
enchantment’ of his voice read the lines in their presence.

'Nsln the latter half of the Aeueid we have, after the ‘Odyssey
of wanderings‚' what has been called the ‘Iliad of battle' : and
it is obvious that the interest of battle-piceas is less in literary

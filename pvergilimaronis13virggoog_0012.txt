1. The serm os tlte poena

The Eclogues of Vergil are apeculiar lorm of composition, and

a word os explanation is required to enable us to understand what

’ the poet was aiming at.

No doubt there were among all the more gifted races living
in southern climates such things as primitive pastoral poets and

, poetry. That shepherds should sing at their work in the fine

days and nights ol the Levant was natural; and even before
such very early inventions as the lyre and flute there were no
doubt pastoral songs. ln the description of the shield of Achilles,
lliad 18. 570, one ol the pictures is that of a boy who iu a
vineyard ‘played sweetly on a clear harp‚ and sang to it the song
of sair Linus' This statement seems to point to early popular
pastoral songs; and we also have records of laments for Daphnis
and Adonis dating back to early times. Anyhow these poems,
*if they existed, are entirely lost; and the first certain pastoral

ἵ poet was the Sicilian Theocritus, wholived at the court of Ptolemy

Philadelphus at Alexandria, and Hiero 11. at Syracuse, during
the lirst hall of the third century uc. The subjeets are very
various, including mythical tales like the death ol Hylas, or the .

figbts of Castor and Pollux3 but the characteristic poems are
1-2

62 INTRODUCTION

an attach on the camp in the absence of Aeneas: the success of '
the hero in his embassy, and his return with succour: the land-

ing, 3ηά the renewed fight, with numerous and various incidents ,
The chief points are the slaughter of the youthful Pallas, son of ,

Euander, by Turnus: the pursuit by the latter of a phantom,
supposed to be Aeneas: and finally the exploits and death of
Mezentius, the exiled cruel Etruscan king.

(Book xl.) A truce is proclaimed‚ and the dead are buried.
We are told of the grami funeral of Pallas; the failure of
Latinus to get aid from Arpi: the quarrels of Drances and
Turnus, ending iu the resolve of the latter to fight: the renewed
encounter: the exploits and death of the -Volscian Camilla ; the
flight of the Latins.

(Book xil.) Latinus and Amata, king and queen of Latium,
entreat Turnus to avoid the combat: but he refuses, and both
warriors prepare for battle. luno urges the nymph luturna,
sister of Turnus, to help him. The treaty is made, that if the
Trojans win, the two natione shall unite. The Rutules object,
and stirred by Iuturna, begin the fight anew. Aeneas is
wounded, and while he is being healed, Turnus rages among
the foe. Aeneas returns, the fight is general: the Trojans
attack the town3' the queen hangs herself. At length the
warriors meet: and after a varied encounter‚ in which Jove,
Iuturna and the Fury take part, Turnus is slain, and the poem
ends.

THE cnoacrcs. 23

(1) Lucretius was the first great poet of Rome: the first
who had used the Greek Hexameter metre with real success, so
as to bring out its power, its dignity, and its beauty, in the Latin
language; the first writer of genius, combining high imagi·
nation, poetic sensibility, deep and serious thought, originality

' and insight; and his poem appeared when Vergil was about 16,

exactly at the time when it was most certain to impress and
inspire a gifted boy, with equal imagination and even more
poetic power.

(2) Vergil's temperament as reveaied in his poetry was
that ol a born lover of nature, delicate and imaginative and
with exquisite sensibility to beauty, naturally religious and
retired and meditative, and like many of the most highly gifted,
with an ‘undertone' of melancholy. Lucretius' poem—dealing
with the productiveness of nature, the vastness of the universe,
the hard struggle of life, the constant pressure and imminence
· of suffering and decay, the mystery of the order of things, the
dari< destiny of man—could not fail to ‘leave a lasting and
profound impression on him.

Thus both in the style and in the thought there was every·
thing to make Lucretius' poem produce a powerful effect on

the younger poet. It is impossible to follow out this effect into
detail; but a few points may be noticed.

(a) ln the diction, the influence is found everywhere
in the Georgica The passages where Vergil directly imitates l
have collected at the end of this section: there are no doubt
many more where a subtle or unconscious memory of Lucretius
has determined the choice of a word or the turn of a phrase.

(b) ln the melre Vergil no doubt made a great advance
on all his predecessors: but it was Lucretius' poem which
shewed him the way, which lifted him to a point whence that
advance was possible. And the list of imitated passages will
shew that the rhythm of Lucretius, with its dignity and beauty,
still inspired some of the best ol Vergil's verses.

(c) ln the thoughts, though Vergil was not a philosopher,
and though he by no means either accepted all Lucretius’ beliefs ι

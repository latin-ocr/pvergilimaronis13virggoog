Latin poete, as we have seen, treated of the same material: and
Naevius in particular, we are told, related that Aeneas was
driven by a storm to Carthage and was entertained by Dido the
queen These stories Vergil adopts, making many alterations
and additions of his own. One great episode, the tragedy of
Dido (in many features oi which the Roman reader oi the time
would inevitably recal Cleopatra), is, as we have seen above
(p. 53), the invention oi Vergil himself, adopting the romantic

The First Book describes how luno,wroth against Aeneas

them alltc a royal banquet. Aeneas at the least summons the
boy Ascanius: but in his stead Venus sends ber son Cupid, who
instils secret love into the hearts of Aeneas and the queen. At
length aiter many questions Dido ¹asks Aeneas to repeat to her
the whole story ol his adventures.

(Book 11.) The story begins. Aeneas tells how after many
defeats the Greeks build the wooden horse, and retire to
Tenedos. While the Trojans are in doubt, aprisoner is brought
in, professing himself a deserter from the Greeks, who reveals
to the Trojans that Troy should conquer Greece if they
admitted the horse to the city. Induced by this, and terrified
by the portentui two snakes which slew Laocoon and his sons,

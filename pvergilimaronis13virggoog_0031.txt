¹ and imaginative poetry. It counts for so much among the
determining conditions os the Georgics that a special word
will be said about the relations between the two poets below.
Itis at any rate clear enough that there are such wide
divergences between the different species of didactic poems‚

that the name ‘ didactic’ tells us very little about the character '

ol a worlc The Georgics differ lrorn the Works and Days
in being a real work of art, aiming all through at beauty: while

. Vergil, if he was not quite as much in earnest as Hesiod in the

precepts he gave, at any rate was really interested in rustic
lif. On the other hand, as compared with Lucretius, while
he follows him in aiming at genuine poetry, and in formulating
serious precepts, he addresses himself much more to the general
reader, and not <as Lucretius did) to the thinker and the student
γ He takes pains by selectiora of details, by episodes (such as the

⁴ storm, i. 3153 the signs ol Caesar’s death, i. 466; the praise of

Italy, ii. 136, dcc), and by rich adornment of every kind, to make -
the poem attractive to those who are not specially interested in
agriculture. He differs again from the Alexandrians in every
way, since neither their precepts nor their art was first hand:
they wrote borrowed facts in an imitated style And he differs
lastly from our own Augustan didactics, inasmuch as their
interest was almost entirely in the style, the subject-matter
being quite secondary and usually chosen because it lent itself
to epigram and finished exposition. ln one word, when we
call the Georgics ‘a didactic poem' we must bear in mind that
it belongs, for all its imitation of Hesiod and Lucretius, to

a unique species

‘The influence’ says Pros. Sellar (Vergil, p. 199) ‘direct and
‘ indirect exercised by Lucretius on the thought, the composition
‘and the style os the Georgics was perhaps stronger than that
‘ever exercised before or since, by one great poet on the work

ol the principal causes and points of this influence.

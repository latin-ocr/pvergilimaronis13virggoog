14 INTRODUCTION

alter ab undecimo tum me iam acceperat annus;
iam fragiles poteram ab terra contingere ramos.
ut vidi, ut perii, ut me malus abstulit error!

These lines have been selected by two such different critics
as Voltalre and Macaulay as the finest lines in all the poet's
works; Macaulay even says in all latin literature. Even if we
do not take too literally these impulsive judgments, we shall all
feel the exquisite delicacy and beauty of the poetry. And our
attention should be particularly drawn to the differences between
Vergil’s lines and the Theocritean verses which he is imitating.
The ‘apples and the hedges' are touches of purely Latin and
bombard scenery; and the whole notion of the two lovers being
at their first meeting children is Vergil’s own. And yet these
arethe touches which give the lines their note of sweet simplicity
and pathos that makes them¹ so strangely lovely.

The Eclogue is prefaced by a formal dedication to Polio
after his victory over the Parthini. We have pointed out above,
in speaking of the dates, that this almost reads as if the poet
had at one time intended to make the 8th Eclogue the concluding
piece of the collection.

If this is so, the 10th Eclogue must have been added as an
afterthought or, as Mr Sellar suggests, it may even have been a
special addition to a second edition of the Eclogues. Of this
there is of course no proof; but it may very well have been so.
In any case it closes the collection.

The contrast between the poetic situation and the actual one
is here most ludicrous. ln the poem-which is inform again
completely Theocritean—we have the shepherd Gallus on a
rock in Arcadia bewailed hythe rivers and tamarisks because
he was dying before his time for love of Lycoris. In reality
Gallus was a rising soldier, high at present in the favour of
Augustus, engaged in the defence of the coasts of Italy, whose

’ἔκ iove· afran wau Cytheris-the original or Lycoris-probably
occupied very little of his real interests. But for all that,
though the incongruity is crude enough, there are also here
lines, which for pure poetic beauty must rank higher than
anything else in the Eclogues. In passages like the following :—

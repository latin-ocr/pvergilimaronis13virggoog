bread‚ honey-stones and logs in the water near hives-the
signs os swarming—the use of ‘tinkling' and ‘dost-throwing'—
the rules tor taking cotuh-the cutting off of empty comb—the
battles os bees.

This, it will be seen, covers nearly the whole ground of what
is really didactic in these later books.

b. Poetical sources.

(6) From Hesiod is horrowed, in the first Georgic, the
passage about lucky and unlucky days, the instruction to ‘sow
and plough stripped,' and various phrases. ln the third Georgic
the only reminiscence of Hesiod is a short passage about dogs
(404 sqq.). The second and fourth Georgic owe nothing.

(7) The astronomical passage in the first Georgic (i. 233)
is in substance from a scientific poern in Greek by Eratosthenes,
mathematician and librarian at Alexandria in the 3rd century B.c.

(8) The Alexandrian poet Aratus (3rd century ne)
wrote ou Astronomy in Greek (Phaenomena) and weather·signs
¹ (De'osemiu), which supplied Vergil with hints sor the passage
“ (i. 351—463) about signs os storms and tairweather, drawn from
the behaviour os birds and beasts and the appearance of the sun
and moon. The works are extant, written ina stiff and frigid
style. ,

(9) Nicander of Colophon, physician aud poet about the
middle of the and century lac„ wrote a poem in Greek on
‘ poisonous animals' (T terebra). The whole passage in Georgic
iii. (414—439), where Vergil treats oi snakes, is based on
Nicander.

The same writer also wrote Georgics, and apoem on Bee-
keeping (Μελισσουργικά), which only survive in fragments. Both
os these Vergil doubtless knew and probably used; and the
latter may have supplied many points lor the fourth Georgic.

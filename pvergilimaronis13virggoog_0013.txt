4 INTRODUCTJON.

those which describe Sicilian shepherd lise3 the sports and
songs of the shepherds3 their loves and jealousies 3ηά quarrels; ¹
the local¹ superstitious ; local tales like that os Galatea and
Cyclops. Tbese subjecta, with lovely touches of Sicilian scenery‚ i
3ηά written in a solt and luxurious yet easy rhythm, make up the ἢ

new.genus of poetry called Bucolic or Pastoral, or sometimes
known by its Theocritean name os the ldyll. ,

Thepoetry of Theocritus is half art and half nature. On the ᾗ
one hand it is the product of a literary epoch and a luxurious
age ; it is a kind of reaction from city and court life in favour of
simplicity‚ open air, and rest. lt is not the spontaneous singing
of shepherds from delight in the song; it is rather the trained

and cultivated court poet who refreshes himself and finds a new l

delight sor his readers by painting in the most mellifluous verse
the sayings and doings-or rather the singings and laziness-of
the Sicilian shepherds. On the otherhand, the shepherds that he
paints are real ; they are there with their sheep, their flutes, their

proverbs‚ their rude quarrels and ruder jests There is plentyof ¹
gaiety andlife and natural beauty, but the country is no ideal 1

home of innocence3 still less is there any learned allegory, or
any masquerading of cultivated persons in the guise of rustics.

But the form of Bucolic poetry once established, it lent itself
-like epic and didactic poetry-to imitation in later literary
ages, by poets who were attracted to the pastoral surrounding
as a convenient setting for their ideas ; but who were as far as
possible from wanting to describe any real pastoral lif. lt
became a convention of poetic art. lt was understood, when
the poet began to talk of shepherds‚ that no real shepherds were
robe thought of ; but the pastoral foreground was a pleasant and
familiar introduction to what the poet wanted to say. lt might
be a nature description ; it might be a lament fora dead friend;
it might be a love story ; it might be somepersonal allusion under
the recognised disguise of shepherd names and pastoral incidents.
This fashion, with all its drawbacks‚ has produced in our
language some of tbe most beautiful poems we have, witness
¹ Lycidas, Adonais, and Thyrsis ; and of this sashion Vergil set
the example.

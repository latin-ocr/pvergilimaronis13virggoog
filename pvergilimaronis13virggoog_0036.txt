THE saoneres 27 -

of Athens at the end ol the sixth book de rerum natura. Though
to the end Vergil's debt to Lucretius remains very deep, the
influence of the latter is in these books beginning to be over·
shadowed by that of a still greater poet (or poets), which in the
Aeneid becomes primary. Nothing is more notable than the
great increase in these luter Georgics of the reminiscences ol
Homer. The poet who began the Georgics with the ambition of
'singing the song of Ascra through the towns ol Rome' ends
with a long episode imitated, and even largely translated, lrorn

the Odyssey.

In the section on the execution of the Georgics below (ξ 8)
enough is said about the attitude ol Vergil and the Augustans
towards Greek literature ; and nothing is more natural than that
the two greatest of all Greek poems, in spite ol all differences
ol age, manner, subject, and diction, should begin to shew the
place they occupied in Vergil's mind. It will be sufficient here
to remark that it is chiefly in the episodes, similes, and other
touches inserted to adorn and vary the ostensible subject of the
, Georgics, that these memories of Homer (naturally) occur.
, Subjoined is a list of the principal Homeric p'aralleb, from
Ribbeck and the commentators.

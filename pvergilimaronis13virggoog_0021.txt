12 INTRODUCTION.

ThfflEclogue is of a wholly diffgggnt character to the
rest; it isa ‘higbemrain' as the poet himself professes.

It is a kind of rapturous &Qumis
Qu age which is to be inaugurated by the new-born

child who is to grow up to he ‘the glory of his time.² The poem
has suffered by the ridiculous—and if it were not sincere, Ι
might have said blaspbemous-notion, which has prevailed
almost throughout all the ages of Christianity, that the fourth
Eclogue contained an inspired MessQthy. lt is
explicable enough that the prophecy of the new golden age,
connected with the birth of a child, appearing so soon before
the Christian era, should have struck the minds of superstitious
Fathers of the Church-especially when neither the dates nor
the circumstances of the poem were very closely looked into.
But we may confidently say that at the best it is not more than
a coincidence. There was no doubt a feeling at the time when
Vergil wrote, and for the whole of his lifetime, that a new and
better age was beginning under the auspices of ΑΜΒ» But
to confound this, or even to connect it, with the Messianic
expectation of tbe Jews, is to attempt to explain a phenomenon
which is perfectly simple and natural-namely the Roman
expectation that after the lmndred years of civil war, the peace
of Augustus was to open a new and a happier era for the Roman
Empire, or in other words for the known world-by the ground·
less and improbable assumption that it was a mysterious reflex
oi the Jewish hope of a Deliverer.

li the theory adopted in the introduction to the fourth
Eclogue be the true one, that the poem was addressed toffltor
and concerned the birth of Polipjgson which took place in the
year 42 when the father of the child happened to be the consul-
then it is quite possible that, mixed with a genuine buoyancy
and hope of the age that was to be under Augustus, there may
also be a touch of half-playful extravagante in the expression
of these sanguine expectations. It does not at all diminish
the beauty of this striking poem, that along with the sincere
rapture of confident hope wherewith not Vergil only, but all the

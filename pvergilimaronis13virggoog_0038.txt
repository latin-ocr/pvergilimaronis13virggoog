6. T he sources of the Georgica

We have discussed brieily the influences of previous writers
on Vergil in thought and sple. lt remains to enumerate the
main sources from which he drew his knowledge; and these
may be conveniently divided into prose sources and poetical
sources, which had best be given as follows in chronological
order.

a. Prose: i. Greek

(1) Xenophon (about 444-357 ne.) in his Oeconomics
(ch. 16—19) gives a short discussion on the nature of soils,
ploughing‚ fallows, harrowing, sowing, preparing grain, and
culture of trees. These hints concern only Georgics 1 and
2. In the same writers treatise on ‘Horses' there are one or
two remarks which directly or indirectly may be the source of
passages in Georgic 3.

(2) Am'stotle(384-32113.c.) in his History of Animals
is evidently the authority directly lor some of Vergil’s state-
· ments about the generation oi animals: especially about boars
(G. iii. 255), the strange superstition of mares being vento
gravidae and flying north and south (iii. 275), the hippomanes
(280) and the importance of the colour oi the ram’s tongue
(388). Also some superstitious about bees (iv. 194, 200, 219).

(3) Theophrastus (about 380-287 uc) wrote a work
on Botany which is still extant, and which Vergil uses in the
second book

ii. Latin.
(4) M. Porcius Cato the Censor (²34-139 ac.) is the
author os a still extant treatise on agriculture (de Re Rustica),

44 INTRODUCTION.

os great men This evidence is vague enough: bnt even il we
make the most ol it, it lalls far short ol proving even the modest

beginnings of epic. Itis clear that the Romans for the first κ

five centuries oi the' republic had neither the leisure nor the
culture, neither the wish nor the power, to produce anything
that could be called literature ; much less anything on so large
a scale, and requiring such imaginative gilts, as the primitive
eprc. ,
lt was the collision of Rome with the Greeks, iu South
Italy (Tarentum taken 272), and in Sicily (first Punic war 264),
that gave the first impulse to literary productiori. Many
Romans learned Greek, taught osten by the slaves: translations
ol Greek were made; the originals were read: the door was
opened. Plays came first: but almost immediately we have
the beginnings of epic poetry. The first Roman poet was
Naevius, who a lew years before 200 B.c. wrote, in the rude
Saturnian metre, an epic on the Punic war. He began with

“ Troy, to which Romans now first seem to have ascribed their

origin: he related the flight from the captive city—the sturm

Punic war. Cicero praises the style of his poem: but from the
fragments it was plainly a terse and simple but rude narrative,
without art or adornment: hardly to be called poetry at all.
A much greater man was Ennius (239-169), a half graecised
Calabrian, a robust soldier and aristocrat‚ who first made real
Latin poetry possible by introducing the Greek epic metre, the

hexameter of Homer. Alter a life spent in various literary at·
tempts, he wrote at the age of 60 his ‘Annales' an epic on the
history ol Rome. He also began with Troy: he brought Aeneas
to Rome: he told the whole history ol the city from the kings

to his own day. It was a long story: there was no plot, no
artistic grouping‚ no proper unity os design : and the style, as the
fragments shew, was rugged and unequal. But it was lifted into
the region os real poetry by the dignity and purpose of the man,
by the central feeling which inspired him oi the greatness and
high destiny of the nation, and by the Roman force and '

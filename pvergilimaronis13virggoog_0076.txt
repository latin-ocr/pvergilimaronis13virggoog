THE AENEJD. 67

his death in a lovely simile to the drooping 31 3 poppy laden
with the rain-an imaginative picture oi siuking loveliness‚ but
omitting altogether the tragic feeling, since the poppy will
revive with the rain, while the youth is dead in his prime.
Again in book 1. Dido advancing to the temple is compared to
Diana on the hills: but the queen is advancing in stately pro-
cession, while the goddess has a quiver on her shoulder, is
circled with throngr'ng nymphs, and plies the dance. To give
yet another instance, in book v. the boat oi Mnestheus in the
race is likened to a dove ‘whose home aud sweet brood are in
the rock's chink' ; which is very pretty and vivid about the
dove, but what has it to do with the boat? Again the simile
says she ‘is startled and makes loud flapping in the cavem,
soon gliding on the still air she skims her liquid way': which
is peculiarly inappropriate to Mnestheus whose course 1311111111-

ln all these cases and in many others the details have no
bearing, and are not meant to have any bearing, 33 the com·
parison. The resemblance turns usually on one point, and that
quite on the suriaco.

This is what we may call the pn'mitive use 31 the simile, as
it is employed in Homer, and imitated in many poets since.
There is however a modern use 31 the simile which is quite
different. 11 we open Shelley we read

“The golden gates 31 Sleep unbar
Where strength and beauty, met together,
Kindle their image like a star

In a sea osglassy weatlter.”

Here there is nothing obvious in the comparison: we should
never have thought, without the aid oi the poet’s superb imagi·
nation, oi comparing the union 31 love to a star mirrored in the

smooth sea: and yet there is a proiound appropriateness, not κ

only in the image, but in all the suggestiom 31 11; the beauty,
the isolation from others, the reflection 31 the brilliance‚ the
infinity, the serenity. Or-again,

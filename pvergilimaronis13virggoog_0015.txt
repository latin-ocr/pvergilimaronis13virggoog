his great uncle Julius Caesar, the army came back, and the
promises which had been made to them of lancis in Italy had
to be fulfilled. The Emperor assigned certain of the lands in
the neighbourhood of the town of Cremona5 amongst which was
„he farm of Vergil at the village ‹ifhndea near Mantua-

Nimium vicina Cremonae, as he calls it. Vergil however had ‘¹

a powerful friend in Asinius Polio, a faithful adherent of Julius
Caesar and afterwards of Augustus. This man, with Alfenus
Varus, also a friend, related to have assisted Polio in his task ·
of distributing the lands‚ and the brilliant but unfortunate
Cornelius Gallus-a poet, a soldier, an intimate of Augustus and
Maecenas, and now colleague of Polio and Vams—pleaded with
the Emperor for Vergil. The intercession was successful, and
the farm was restored.

If this explanation, which is so far undoubted‚ contains all
the facts, then the nintlr Eclogue, expressing as it does the
co int of the dispossessed Vergil, is the earlier, and the first,
whic contains his wude, is the later of the two. Servius
however in his comme'· ry tells us, and some people have found
reason in the language of EclogueQu-ratasuppose, that
there were two stages to the proceeding; ¹that the poet was
dispossessed ; then applied to the Emperor, successfully ; that
the soldier in possession refused to give up the farm, and was
violent, even to the peril of Vergil’s life; that then the poet
applied again and the recalcitrant occupier was ejected. Those
who take this view make the first Eclogue refer to the earlier
restoration, and the ninth to the second stage when the soldier
refused to go. But though of this complex situation there is not
sufficient evidence, the wording of the ninth Eclogue does
suggest a hitch1. ln either case the two belong to the same

¹ Menalcas complains he has lost his farm. Lycidas replies, ‘I
thought you had saved it by your poems.’ Menalcas replies ‘It was so
reported: but songs against armed soldiers are no ruore use than doves
against eagles.' The most likely interpretation is that Vergil had hoped
by his influence to escape being dispossessed, but that his friends could
not prevent that: that he then wrote the ‘disappointed' Eclogue 9:
that Polio, Varus and Gallus advised him (and probably helped him)

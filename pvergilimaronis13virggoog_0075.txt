stage from the avenging ghost of Clytaemnestra. Once, again, l

the poet is misled by his Greek original into being inadequate

and almost grotesque, when he compares (vii. 138) the maddened Ἴ

Amata rushing wildly through the city to a top driven hy the
lashes oi boys' whips. But ior the most part in the Vergilian

' simile, as in Homesss, both the point of comparison is simple

and obvious, and the comparison itself falls into one or other of
a few common types.

Thus vehare the similes oi siae or force: warriors compared
to trees (pine, ash or oak) or to animals (eagle, lion, hawk, bull,
bear, wolf) or again to giants, mountains, centaurs or Gods:
The similes oi movement: Dido wandering like a deer,
Mercury scudding like a cormorant‚ darts flying like cranes,
Iuturna like a swallow, the Fury like an arrow: Τὴε similes oi
crowds: the toiling workmen like bees, armies gathering like
vinds, hursting in like floods, trooping like waves, advaucing
like the Ganges: The similes of beau& or bnghtness: Dido
bright as Diana, Aeneas like Apollo, Pallas like a morning star,
the blushing Lavinia like stained ivory, Ascanius like a jewel
cased in gold: The similes of mise: Laocoon like a bull
roaring, the Tuscan troops like singing flights oi swans, the
sound of battle like the roaring oi a burning forest: The
similes of emotion: the Trojan women cowering like (loves, the
flash οῖ’ passion like lightning, hesitation like the flickering
light, Latius fluttered like birds, a coward slinking oti like a
startledwoli.

In all these the point οἰ comparison would occur to any one:
but the workmanship of the simile is careful, and the image is
elaborated quite independently of the resemblance. Ordinarily
· the simile is not really meant to illustrate in the strict sense,
that is to help us to realise the action3 it is simply used as a
variety, a reliei, an adomment to the narrative. The art is
shewn, not in the selection of the simile, which lies at hand:
but in the vividness of the picture, the heauty of the language,
the aptness and truthfulness of the details.

, And these details are often quite irrelevant to the comparison.
For example, in hook ix, the youth Euryalus is compared at

THE AENEJD. 47

so, first, because the house of the Caesars, the gens lulia,
traced back its origin to Iulus, son oi Aeneas3 but chiefly
because it gave him so convenient an opportunity of bringing
before his countrymen‚ in a national dress the glorious
poems os Homer. The battle-picces, the sea-adventures, the
councils of the gods, the single combats, the royal feasts and

, funerals, the splendid scenes and similes-all these things,

which charmed the educated Romans so much in the Greek
epics, Vergil transplanted and naturalized in his own stately
and melodicus verse. Moreover, by going back to Aeneas and
the tale ol Troy, he raised the destinies ol Rome to the old
heroic level in the imaginations ol men. But however much oi
Homer he may give to his readers, he never sorgets his main

pay more attention than to a revival of the national religion.

the shrines, increased the priestly colleges, and took the office
permanently of Pontifex maximus. And the poet himself
viewed Rome as a state powerlul by the protectiones gods,
great in its ancient and elaborate ceremonial, and predestined
by the divine will to its career os Empire. Hence it is that he is
caresul to weave into his narrative all manner of religious rele-
rences, allusions‚ and associations. Sacred places and customs
are mentioned all through3 and the background of the poem
is the working os the gods themselves, with F ate ordaining all

Nor should we surget the antiquarian interest. The unity
of the race and the greatness ol its destiny gave ahigh signifi·
cance to all old memories. Accordingly Vergil has collected
into his poem a mass of local traditions¹, old Latin customs,
explanatione ol names, and antiquarian lore ol all kinds. He
leels that nothing can so stimulate the common patriotism, and

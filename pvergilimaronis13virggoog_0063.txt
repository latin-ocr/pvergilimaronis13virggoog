54 INTRODUCTION.

' of Egeria, the Gabine ‘cinctus,' the Gabii, Potitii, Pinarii, the
cultos Hercules, and even of minor deities, as Palicus, Feronia,
Carmentis, Pilumnus, Venilia. And above all the opportunity
which the poet makes for himself in the shield of Aeneas
(viii. 630) is used for this national purpose with skill and success.
The idea of describing the moulding of the shield is of course
from Homer: but nothing could be more characteristic of the
two nations than the contrast between the two shields as
painted by the Greek and the Roman poet. On the shield of
Achilles (Il. 18. 483) we trace, wrought by the god’s hand, a
bridal procession, a throng in the market, a beleaguered city,
an ambush, a fallow field and ploughing team, reapers in the
swathe, a vineyard at vintage time, a pasture, a lion hunt, a
dance of youths and maidens ; and ‘great ocean's mighty stream
to ring the margin’: we have in a word the Greek, with his
bright love of life and his deep instinct for the beautiful. On
the shield of Aeneas we have the pictured story of early Rome:
the wolf and her sucklings, the rape of the Sabine women, the
league of Rome and Alba, the treachery of Mettius, the revo-
lution against the tyrant kings, Horatius who kept the bridge
and Cloelia who swam the river, Manlius and the Gauis: and
last we have the battle of Actium, the hard-won peace after
roo years of civil war; the youthfui victor’s triumph, and the
submission of the world. The Greek shield is human life: the
Roman shield is the greatness of Rome. And the book ends
with a grand verse, the climax of a hundred stately lines, telling
us how the hero‘lifts upon his shoulders the fame and fates of
his sons.²

So far we have been dealing with the scheme of the Aeneid:

· but the poet is seen even more in the detailed workmanship-in
the mette, the music, the feeling, the dignity, the insight, the
magic of phrase, the many qualities which defy analysis, but
which go to make up the profound and indelible effectos the
greatest poetry. Of these large and difficult topics it is impossible
to speak here at any length: the student will find some aid in

the works above referred to ¹, but mostly these higher qualities
¹ Particularly Sellar and Myers. '

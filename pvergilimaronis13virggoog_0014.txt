THE acroouas. 5

Vergil was steeped fr boybood in Greek3 and that he
should begin his poetic caree by imitation ol Greek models was
both natural and indeed inevitable. lt was also particularly
natural that he should be attracted first to Theocritus. The
ldylls were short poems, fit sor a first ssight. The imitation
allowed considerable range of subject3 and this range he
extended. Moreover Theocritus at his best is extremely beauti-
ful, with just the sort of dreamy and luscious beauty most attrac-
tive to youth; and to a youth ol Vergil’s delicate ear and exquisite
taste irresistibly tempting to imitate. Lastly it was an untrled
field How he carried out this original literary venture we shall
see below: but it is first necessary to discuss the order in which
the Eclogues were written.

2· Dates of the Eclogues.

There is a good deal of uncertainty about the dates ol several
of these poems; but without attempting to fix the dates exactly
os all, we ean group them pretty conlidently in an approximate
chronological order.

Eclogues 2, 3, and ς clearly belong together; they are all
early work, and close Theocritean imitations; and the second and
third are mentioned in the fifth, lines 86—87‚ in a way which
suggests that these two were the only ones then written when
the tilth was being composed. The lament for Daphnis in this
last poem, and particularly the passage which speaks ol -the
deification of the shepherd, lines 56-64, and the coupling ol
Daphnis with the altars of Apollo line 66, bas with great
probability been supposed tleertoJulius Caesar ; rand it has
been conjectured moreover that it was written for the sacred
birthday of Julius Caesar held on the 4tb July‚ Ite. 42, when the
name ol the mouth Quintilis was changed first to Julius. This
falls in with internal probability ; and we may provisionally fix
42 as the date by which this group was finished.

The second group consists ol Ecl 1 and 9, which concern the

question ol the farm at Andes. After the battle ol Philippi in
lac· 42, in which the Emperor Augustus then called Octavianus,
had defeated the party of Brutus and Cassius, the morderers os

the artificial style of Pope and his followers, produced many
examples besides Wordsworth of the simple style, such as
Moore, Sonthey, Campbell, much ol Byron and Coleridge, and
the whole os Walter Scott Two oi the greatest however,
Keats and Shelley, hom the gorgeous imagination ol the one
and the prosound inspiration of the other, supply more examples
of the elaborate and forcible style.

Now Vergil’s poetry belongs largely to this second class. It
is true that he can be simple, and often is: he is much too great
an artist to ignore any poetic resource But ior the most part
he does not aim at expressing his thoughts in the simplest, but
rather in the most striking manner. He often employs ‘ an
elaboration of language which disdains or is unable to say a
plain thing in a plain way¹.' He arrests attention by the
vigour, the strangeness, the intensity, the emphasis, if l may so
phrase it, of his languagh He is often stretching constructions

or the sense of words, using abstract for concrete, part sor the ἵ

whole, adjective for adverb3 transferring epithets‚ varying, in·
verting‚ secking the unusual instead of the ordinary phrase.
ln short he is constantly surprising the reader.

The good side os these peculiarities is freshness and force:
the bad side is affectation. The protections against affectation
are of course the poet's own taste, command of expression,
ear sor melody, dignity‚ imagination‚ and skill; and all these
qualities Vergil possesses in a consummate degree.

Those who wish to examine further into this point will find
(in the Index of style) arough attempt to classify the instances

which illustrate it For the present it will suffice to append a ·

few of the most remarkable.
Thus Vergil has a tendency to inversion or variation'

Vergil will find most instructive, interesting and suggestive, as indeed is
to be expected os so distinguished a scholar.

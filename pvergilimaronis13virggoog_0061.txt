fourth book that his conduct to Dido is both cruel and mean.
To some extent this criticism is true. Perhaps however Aeneas

has both been attacked and defended¹ too much as a modern Ἰ

hero of romance. To the Roman readers he would seem not so
much an actual hero of primitive epic like Achilles, whose deeds
and sufferings were the main interest ; but rather a national
representative, a sort oi personal allegory of the history oi Rome,
the depository of the divine destiny of ,the empire. Against
his late it would seem right that the passionate Dido, like the
violent Turnus or the barbarous Latins, should strike and be
broken. That pity should be felt ior the victim (as Vergil
plainly himself felt and meant us to leel), was due to the very
art and genius of the poem. The Roman iate must trample on
all obstacles‚ and is the innocent suffered, that was part of the
common lot oi man, and a matter os course: what was new was
to be made by the poet to feel the pathos and the injustice,

The first readers, too, would be struck in another way with
the skill of the poet, namely in bis handling of the current
legend.

The ‘wanderings ol Aeneas' was a theme oi the earlier

Roman epics; butio Vergil's hands they are no mere sea· ’

adventures; they serve the double purpose ol literary reminis·
cence and solemn lorecast of the national destiny. ln the
third book we read of the visit to Delos, where Aeneas receives
the first obscure prophecy (iii. 84): the abortiva settlement in
Crete, where in a dteam the hero is first told clearly ol ltaly
(ib. 144); the tale ὀί the Harpies, one of whom repeats the
prophecy with warnings (247) 3 the meeting in Epiros with
Andromache, now wedded to the seer Helenus, who gives them

yet a fourth announcement os their destiny, this time in the
lullest detail (374); and the voyage to Sicily, a skilful opening
ior the Odyssey tales of Scylla and Charybdis, and the giant

Polyphemus.
No less remarkable would be the new and striking colour

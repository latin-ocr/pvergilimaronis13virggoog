68 INTRODUCTION.

“Life like a dome os many-coloured glass
Staius tte white radiance osEternity
Untr'l Death tramples it to fragments.”

Here too the comparison is not at all obvious: it is fetched
from far by the poet's deeper insight and quicker sensibility:
and it is splendidly illustrative all through: the bright colours
compared with the pure white light resembling the chequered

’ shifting imperfect beauties of life compared with the changeless

perfection of eternity: the narrow limited dome and the endless
vault of heaven giving another equally deep contrast: and lastly,
the perishable glass contrasted with the etemal spaces of the
universe.

The more such similes are studied, the richer light is thrown
on the comparison: they are not, like Vergil's, poetic miniature
· pictores to be enjoyed independently; they are profound lu-
minous resemblances, a permanent addition to our fancy and
insight, for which we are grateful to the higher gifts of the
poet. -

l have said so much, to make it clear, that what Vergil aims '
at in his similes is something quite different (and in one sense
far less) than what the modern poet (especially the lyric poet)
aspires to: for in order to appreciate the true poetic success of
Vergil, it is clearly necessary to understand his object, and so
ι avoid the mistake of judging him by an erroneous standard

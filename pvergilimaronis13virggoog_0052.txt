THE AENEID.

C. Tua Asuero. .

1. The form of tlte poem.

We have seen above that Vergil, both in his ldyls and his
didactic poetry‚ was imitating Greek models: but though in the
Eclogues he plainly wished to be the Latin Theocritus, and in
the Georgics openly claims to ‘sing the song ol Ascra through
the Roman towns,’ he really so far diverged in the handling
from his models, that he produced in each case what was prac-
’ tically a new form os poetry. Itis the same with the Aeneid;
but there are points in this case which require explanation.

ln the great epic age of Greece, which was the beginning
ol all European literature, all the poems produced, at any rate
in their final shape, were long narratives in hexameter verse
about kings and heroes, their lile, their wars, and their ad·
ventures. The Iliad and the Odyssey were, as is well known,
only the two earliest and most famous of a large number ol
these Greek poetic tales; and other imaginative races at an
early period os their development have produced similar heroic
poems, ol which the best known are the Nibelungenlicd, the
Sagae and the Song os Roland. These are what are known as
priminae epics: poetic stories ol battles and perils‚ told lor
love ol the story. ’

The Roman rece produced no primitive epic properly so
called. They had plenty ol early tales (relating to the deeds of
their ancestors, and preserved mainly by the family annals),
which were admirably adapted to be the material ol such epics,
as can be seen from the vivid prose narrative ol' Livy, or still
better from the stirring ‘Lays’ into which the genius ol
Macaulay so happily transmuted them. There is even evidence
that some ol these tales were known in the form of songs in
republican times. Thus the earliest Roman annalist, Fabius
Pictor (about 200 act), implies that some old songs about
Romulus survived to his time: and Cato the Censor (who lived
about the same period) tells us in his ‘Antiquities' that many
centuries besore bis time songs were sung at banquets in praise

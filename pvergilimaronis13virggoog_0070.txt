THE AENEID. 61

So all demand war: and luno opens the ‘Gates of Wan’ The
rest of the book gives a catalogue of the chieftains and their
mera

(Book vill.) An embassy is sent to Argyripa to request the
aid of the Greek Diomedes. Meanwhile Father Tiber appears
in a vision to Aeneas, and tells him that he has reached his
destined home, and that he must make friends with Euander
the Arcadian, settled on the site of the future Rome. He
accordingly sails up the river with a few followers, and is
hospitably received by the king Euander and his son Pallas.
They invite them to the feast, tell them the legend of Hercules,
make friends, and the king shews Aeneas over the city. 'Mean-
while Venns persuades Vulcan to make armour for Aeneas ; and
we have a description of the volcanic forge. Euander bids
farewell to his son Pallas, who accompanies Aeneas to the
Etruscan camptu ask for aid There Venus brings Aeneas his
divinely fashioned armour3 and the rest of the book is occupied
with a description of the shield‚ and the scenes from the history '
of the future Rome that are carved upon it.

(Book 1x.) luno wams Turnus that Aeneas is away, and
accordingly the Latin and Rutule army advance‚ the Trojans
retiring to their camp. The Trojan ships, threatened with lire,
change into nymphs and disappear. Turnus exhorts his men,
and they prepare for battle, passing the night in sport and
carousal. Two friends, Nisus and Euryalus, resolve to surprise
the Latin camp. Obtaining leave and encouragement from
the elders they make a night attack and massacre the sleepers.
Retiring at dawn, they are espied and pursued by a troop of
Latin horse, and Euryalus is caught: Nisus in a vain attempt
to save his friend is likewise slain, and the two heads are
exposed on poles. The Latins advance‚ andin the melec the
foes get inside the Trojan camp, whence after much havoc they
are ejected Turnus rushes to the rescue and is himself shut in
the camp, where he slaughters a heap of Trojans, but is finally
driven out by degrees, till he leaps into the river and is
washed down to his own friends.

grandeur 01 many 01 the lines. After Ennius there were other
minor Annalists such as Furius and Hostius, about the begin·
ning ol the first century: and in Cicero’s time epic poetry de·
generated into mere panegyric, such as Varro's poem on Julius
Caesar's Gaulish campaigns, and Cicero’s on Marius, and even
on himself: till it became naturally 3 court lashlon under
Augustus.

It is evident at once that these poems, though called epics
and no doubt suggested by Homer, had altogether lost the
character 01 the primitive epic The workmanship, as iar as we
can judge, was rude: the bulk 01 them being history, parts even
contemporary history, the imaginative side was absent ; and the
narrative was long and shapeless, devoid 01 dramatic unity and
effect. A still more important difference was that the Roman
epics told thestery for a purpose, and not like Homer for love
01 the character and incident. They should be classed as

· patriotic and poetic annalists, and not as epic poets at all.

The originality 01 Vergil consisted in this, that he combined
the beauty and artistic handling 01 the primitive epic with the
patriotic purpose 01 the annalists. The age 01 Augustus was as
vae-have seen (p. 19) preeminently an age 01 artistic finish and
01 Greek imitation. Vergil had been the Roman Theocritus
and Hesiod: he was now to be the Roman Homer. The
voyage 01 the Trojans to Italy was the new Odyssey: the
struggle against the Latins was the new Iliad. But the real
subject 01 the Aeneid, as we shall see below, was Rome. Thus
the poet created in Epic, as he had don'e in Bucolic and Didactic
poetry, a new genus, which critics have suitably named the
literary apic. The essence 01 the distinction, to resume what
we have said, is this: the primitive epic belongs to an early
period 01 development, and describes heroic adventure and
natural scenes, with a vivid simphcity‚ ior love 01 the story:
while the literary epic, though more or less similar in form,
belongs to a later epoch 01 culture, is less spontaneous and
more artificial, and has some great central idea which is the

Ι purpose 01 the tale.

Vergil had a host 01 imitators in the new department 01

PREFACE.

HIS edition ol Vergil is the reissue, in a collected and
revised shape, of the single books of Vergil which I
have been editing for the last fifteen years. Itis inevitable
that the views ol an editor who continues to work at a
subject for that time should undergo some change, not
merely as to the meaning ol difficult or doubtful passages,

’ or on questions of reading, but also as to the style and even ’

the scale of annotation required. The changes that seemed
to be thus required have been made, and the notes on the
later books, which· were first issued, have been slightly
modilied to suit the more recent work on the Eclogues,
Georgics, and earlier Aeneids.

In the Introduction, which has been rewritten, and (in
the case ol the Aeneid) considerably increased, I have
endeavoured to supply what I believe the beginner often
wants and does not know where to look for. I have tried
to expound as briefly and clearly as I could what the poet
was in his three poems respectively trying to achieve, what
were the circumstances, literary and other, under which he
wrote, and where the peculiar merits ol the execution lie.
In such an attempt at the ‘Elements of Criticism' on Ver·
gil, there are, I arn well aware, many difficulties. To avoid
cram, and prolixity, and dulness, and obscurity: to praise

lor the right thing, in the right words, with proper sense of
s-v.1. 1

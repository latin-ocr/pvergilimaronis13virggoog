epic, where it must be artificial, than in a primitive epic, where
it was to the hearers one oi the main realities of life. This was
less the case no doubt, as explained above, to the Roman
reader, because the direct imitation oi Homer, in manner,
incident, and even wording, was alike what he desired and
enjoyed‚ and what the poet openly offered and strove to
give him. Accordingly the later books have a great deal of
fighting: much oi the tenth and the latter halt oi the ninth
is almost entirely made up oi battle. Still Vergil's tact ieels the
need oi relies to the monotony: and the story gives us much
beauty and variety of incident. The tale oi Nisus and Euryalus
(in ix.) is one of the most touching episodes in poetry. The
story ol Hercules and Cacus (viii. 185) is avigorous piece of epic
mythology.- The beautiful idyl oi the forester’s daughter in tho
seventh book, and the picture of Camilla in the seventh
and eleventh, add an interest of a different sort; the deaths
of Pallas and oi Lausus in book x. relieve the carnage with
pathos; and the council of Latius in book xi, with the
controversy oi Iuppiter and Iuno in x, are dramatic interludes
shewing the poets power in the new domaiu oi sorcible and
scornful rhetoric

Is it be said, as modern writers have urged1, that the
interest oi the Aeneid lies in the episodes, and that the episodes
overshadow the poem, there are many considerations to quality
such a criticism. lna long poem belonging to a different
civilisation there is sure to be much that has ceased to interest:
even in the Iliad it is not the camage and the exploits of battle
that make us feel its greatness. ln the Aeneid, again, though
some episodes, like those of Euryalus and Camilla, are adom·
ments, others, like the sack oi Troy, Dido, and the visit to
Avernus, are of the very essence of the story that has to be told.
lt is a more telling criticism that the main hero Aeneas, with
his load oi ‘lates' and his rather wearisome ‘piety,' suggests a
fatal comparison with the noble and lise-like Achilles; that in
general he does 'not evoke our sympathy, and particularly in the

THE GEORGICS. 41

and its freedom from pettiness of spirit and degrading luxury
and noxious cares, was the true school of that manliness, energy
and worth, which had made Rome great.

As to the first, the patn‘otic feeling, there can be no doubt
that Vergil was deeply imbued with it; it is the inspiration
more than any other single sentiment of the whole Aeneid, and
particularly of the grand catalogue of Rome's worthies which
is the climax of the sixth book. lf Italy was magna parens
frugum (ti. 173) she was no less magna virum,· and the ‘Decii
Marii, and great Camilli, and Scipios hardy in war’ (169) are
no less present to the poet's mind in writing the Georgics than
when laterbe is marshalling in one grand vision the procession
of heroes which makes the history of Rome. This is the spirit
which animates the majestic vision of triumph at the opening of
the third Georgic (za—32), where the poet's enthusiasm is made
all the more noticeable by the very difficulty (see notes) of
fitting his large phrases to the facts. The strength of this
feeling too must excuse, if anything can excuse, the turgid

lt seems incongruous to us that a serious poet should be guilty
of such flattery: that he should gravely speak of ‘Tethys
huying Augustus to be her daughter’s husband with the dowry
of all her waves,' or the ‘Scorpion drawing back his claws'
to make room for the emperor as a 13th Zodiac-sign; but we
must in faimess remember, not only the usual conventions of

courts and court-poetry‚ but the real enthusiasm for the new ·

era which the poets‚ as well as everyone else at the tirne,
undoubtedly felt. ‘The good time was come’: and we who
know how largely their hopes were disappointed, must make
allowance for the exaggeration which was natural when such
hopes were nearly universal.

As to the second, the moral feeling, it was both in the main
true and sound, and it was peculiarly natural to a poet of
Vergil’s sensitive and meditative spirit, brought up in the
country, and plunged into the tumult, not merely of town life,
but court life in the capital The splendours, the luxuries, the
pleasures of his new life did not attract him: they only made

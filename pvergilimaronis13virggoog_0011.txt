proportion; to assume neither too much nor too little know·
ledge in the reader, to be neither usgue, nor frigid, nor
dogmatic ;-1 cannot hope in all these things to hit the
mark. But Ι have acted on the belief that it is helpful to
¹ the student to make the attempt.

· With the text of Vergil there are not many grave diffi-
culties. Apart from obvious and easily corrected errors of
the uss, and needless conjectures of editors, there are
few disputed points ol much importance. Where the read·
ing is really difficult to decide, Ι have given reasons
briefly lor the one preferred. I have found Conington,

Kennedy, and above all Ribbeck, nsesul in supplying data ’

sor these decisions.
In the preparation ol notes, Ι have naturally avalled
myself of the aid of all the principal commentators and

editors. Ι may mention specially Servius, Conington, ,

Heyne, Forbiger, Wagner, Gossrau, Hemy, Kennedy,

Papillon, and Ladewig. The ‘translations of Conington, ’

Lee and Lonsdale‚ Sir C. Bowen, Mon-is (Aeneid)‚ and
Rhoades (Georgics)‚ Ι have used and occasionally quoted.

The Indices have been arranged afresh: and I have
there tried to meet the needs os those who are studying
the language ol Vergil, by giving the various usages
properly classified, so that it may be easy to find nselul
and instructive illustration.

For the matter ol the Introduction Ι have been indebted
to the prelaces ol the various editions named above3 to
Simcox’s Latin Literature 3 F. W. H. Myers' striking essay
on Vergil 3 and not least to the interesting and suggestive
work on the poet by Professor Sellar.
